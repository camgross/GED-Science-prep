## What Is Scientific Reasoning?

Scientific reasoning is the process of using logic and evidence to understand the natural world. It is not about memorizing facts. Instead, it is about asking good questions, gathering evidence, and drawing conclusions that are supported by data. On the GED Science Test, scientific reasoning is the single most important skill you will use.

Scientific reasoning involves several key habits of mind:

- **Observation** — noticing patterns in data or the natural world
- **Inference** — drawing logical conclusions from evidence
- **Prediction** — using patterns to forecast what might happen next
- **Evaluation** — judging whether a conclusion is well-supported

Every question on the GED Science Test requires some form of scientific reasoning, whether you are reading a passage, interpreting a graph, or evaluating an experiment.

Type: workflow

Bloom Taxonomy: Understand
Bloom Taxonomy Verb: explain
Learning Objective: Explain the steps involved in scientific reasoning and how they connect in a continuous cycle.

Purpose: Visualize the scientific reasoning process as a cyclical flow, showing how observation leads to questioning, hypothesis formation, evidence gathering, analysis, and conclusion — and how conclusions can loop back to new observations.

Steps:
1. "Observe" — Notice something in the world or in data
Hover text: "All scientific reasoning begins with careful observation of patterns, events, or data."

2. "Question" — Ask why or how something happens
Hover text: "Good questions are specific, testable, and based on observations."

3. "Hypothesize" — Propose a possible explanation
Hover text: "A hypothesis is an educated guess that can be tested with evidence."

4. "Gather Evidence" — Collect data through experiments or research
Hover text: "Evidence can be quantitative (numbers) or qualitative (descriptions)."

5. "Analyze" — Look for patterns in the evidence
Hover text: "Analysis involves organizing data, finding trends, and making comparisons."

6. "Conclude" — Determine what the evidence supports
Hover text: "A conclusion must be directly supported by the evidence collected."

7. Arrow from "Conclude" back to "Observe" — New conclusions raise new questions
Hover text: "Science is iterative — each answer leads to new observations and questions."

Visual style: Circular flowchart with rounded rectangle steps connected by directional arrows. The loop-back arrow from Conclude to Observe should be visually prominent.

Color scheme: Blue gradient progressing from light (Observe) to dark (Conclude), with the loop-back arrow in green.

Interactive features:
- Hover over each step to see description in tooltip
- Click a step to highlight it and dim the others
- Animated pulse on the loop-back arrow to emphasize the cyclical nature

## The GED Assessment Framework

Before diving deeper into science content, it helps to understand how the GED Science Test is organized. The test is built around two key ideas: **Assessment Targets** and **Career and College Readiness Standards**. Understanding the framework helps you study smarter, because you can focus on the skills the test actually measures.

### Assessment Targets

Assessment targets are the specific skills and knowledge areas that the GED Science Test measures. Think of them as a roadmap for what you need to know. The GED Science Test has two types of assessment targets:

- **Science Practices** — the thinking and reasoning skills you need (like interpreting data, designing experiments, and evaluating claims)
- **Content Topics** — the actual science knowledge areas (Life Science, Physical Science, Earth and Space Science)

Every question on the test connects to at least one science practice and one content topic. This means the test never asks you to just recall a fact — it always asks you to do something with that knowledge.

| Assessment Target Type | What It Measures | Example |
|------------------------|------------------|---------|
| Science Practices | How you think scientifically | Interpreting a graph of population growth |
| Content Topics | What science you know | Understanding how cells divide |

</details>

### Career and College Readiness Standards

The GED Science Test is designed to show that you are ready for college-level coursework or a career that requires scientific thinking. The Career and College Readiness (CCR) Standards define the level of performance expected. This means the test goes beyond basic recall — it asks you to:

- Analyze information from multiple sources
- Apply scientific concepts to real-world scenarios
- Evaluate the quality of evidence and arguments
- Communicate scientific ideas clearly

These standards ensure that passing the GED Science Test is meaningful. Employers and colleges can trust that a GED holder has the critical thinking skills needed for success.

#### Diagram: Career and College Readiness Standards Alignment

<details markdown="1">

## Science Practices

Science practices are the specific reasoning skills the GED Science Test expects you to demonstrate. There are seven science practices, and they describe *how* you should be able to work with scientific information:

1. **Comprehending Scientific Presentations** — understanding text, graphs, tables, and diagrams
2. **Investigation Design** — identifying variables, hypotheses, and experimental setups
3. **Reasoning from Data** — drawing conclusions from evidence and data
4. **Evaluating Conclusions with Evidence** — judging whether claims are supported
5. **Working with Findings** — connecting results across investigations
6. **Expressing Scientific Information** — communicating data and conclusions
7. **Scientific Theories** — understanding and applying major scientific theories

Each of these practices builds on the foundational reasoning skills introduced in this chapter. Later chapters will explore each practice in detail.

#### Diagram: Science Practices Wheel

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Science Practices Wheel</summary>
Type: diagram

Bloom Taxonomy: Remember
Bloom Taxonomy Verb: list
Learning Objective: List and recognize the seven GED Science Practices and their relationship to scientific reasoning.

## Content Topics

Content topics are the science subject areas covered on the GED Test. Unlike science practices (which are about *how* you think), content topics are about *what* you know. The three content domains and their approximate test weights are:

| Content Domain | Test Weight | Key Topics |
|---------------|-------------|------------|
| Life Science | 40% | Human body, health, ecosystems, genetics, evolution |
| Physical Science | 40% | Energy, motion, chemical reactions, forces |
| Earth and Space Science | 20% | Earth systems, atmosphere, oceans, space |

Two focusing themes cut across all three domains:

- **Human Health and Living Systems** — topics related to the health and safety of living things
- **Energy and Related Systems** — topics related to sources, transformations, and uses of energy

These themes help connect concepts across domains. For example, energy transformation appears in Life Science (photosynthesis), Physical Science (electricity), and Earth Science (solar radiation).

#### Diagram: Content Topics Domain Map

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Content Topics Domain Map</summary>
Type: chart

Bloom Taxonomy: Remember
Bloom Taxonomy Verb: identify
Learning Objective: Identify the three content domains of the GED Science Test and their relative weights.

Chart type: Pie chart with expandable sections

Purpose: Visualize the distribution of content topics across the three GED Science domains, with subtopics visible on interaction.

Data:
- Life Science: 40% (green)
  - Subtopics: Human body and health, Energy flows in ecosystems, Cellular organization, Heredity, Evolution
- Physical Science: 40% (blue)
  - Subtopics: Energy conservation, Work and motion, Chemical properties, Reactions
- Earth and Space Science: 20% (purple)
  - Subtopics: Earth systems, Atmosphere, Oceans, Cosmic structures

Interactive elements:
- Hover over any slice to see the domain name, percentage, and subtopic list
- Click a slice to expand it and show a brief description of each subtopic
- Two focusing theme icons (heart for Health, lightning bolt for Energy) appear as toggle filters — when activated, they highlight which subtopics fall under each theme

Labels: Domain names and percentages displayed on each slice

Implementation: Chart.js or p5.js pie chart with interaction

## Depth of Knowledge (DOK)

Depth of Knowledge (DOK) describes how deeply you need to think to answer a question. The GED Science Test uses three DOK levels, and about 60% of questions are at DOK Level 2 or 3 — meaning they require more than simple recall.

| DOK Level | Description | What It Looks Like |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| Level 1: Recall | Remember facts, definitions, or simple procedures | "What is the chemical symbol for water?" |
| Level 2: Skill/Concept | Apply concepts, compare, organize, interpret | "Based on the graph, which year had the highest rainfall?" |
| Level 3: Strategic Thinking | Reason, plan, justify, draw conclusions from multiple sources | "Using the data table and passage, explain why the researcher's conclusion may be flawed." |

Understanding DOK levels helps you prepare because you know the test rewards deep thinking, not just memorization.

#### Diagram: Depth of Knowledge Pyramid

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Depth of Knowledge Pyramid</summary>
Type: infographic

Bloom Taxonomy: Understand
Bloom Taxonomy Verb: explain
Learning Objective: Explain the three DOK levels used on the GED Science Test and recognize what each level requires from the test-taker.

Purpose: Show the three DOK levels as a pyramid with increasing cognitive demand from bottom to top, along with the percentage of test questions at each level.

Layout: Pyramid/triangle divided into 3 horizontal layers

Bottom layer (widest — DOK 1: Recall):
- ~40% of test questions
- Verbs: define, identify, list, recall, recognize
- Example: "What is the function of the cell membrane?"
- Color: Light blue

Middle layer (DOK 2: Skill/Concept):
- ~40% of test questions
- Verbs: compare, interpret, organize, classify, infer
- Example: "Based on the graph, what trend do you observe?"
- Color: Medium blue

Top layer (narrowest — DOK 3: Strategic Thinking):
- ~20% of test questions
- Verbs: analyze, justify, evaluate, formulate, critique
- Example: "Using both data sources, explain whether the hypothesis is supported."
- Color: Dark blue

Interactive elements:
- Hover over each layer to see full description, example verbs, and a sample question
- Click a layer to expand it and show 3 sample GED-style question stems
- Animated percentage bars alongside each layer showing test weight
- A small quiz: a question appears and the student must click which DOK level it belongs to

Instructional Rationale: This infographic uses progressive disclosure (hover/click) so learners can first see the overall structure, then explore each level in depth. The embedded mini-quiz reinforces Bloom's Analyze level by requiring classification.

## Test Item Alignment

Every question (or "item") on the GED Science Test is carefully aligned to a specific combination of elements:

- One or more **Science Practices** (the reasoning skill being tested)
- One **Content Topic** (the subject area)
- One **DOK Level** (the depth of thinking required)

This three-way alignment means you should prepare by practicing all three dimensions together. For example, you might practice interpreting a graph (Science Practice 3) about population genetics (Life Science content) at DOK Level 2 (interpreting data patterns).

#### Diagram: Test Item Alignment Grid

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Test Item Alignment Grid</summary>
Type: diagram

Bloom Taxonomy: Analyze
Bloom Taxonomy Verb: examine
Learning Objective: Examine how GED Science test items are constructed by aligning science practices, content topics, and DOK levels.

Purpose: Show the three-dimensional alignment of a GED test item, helping students understand that every question tests a specific practice, content area, and depth of knowledge simultaneously.

Layout: A 3D cube or three intersecting planes

Axis 1 (X): Science Practices (SP.1 through SP.7)
Axis 2 (Y): Content Topics (Life, Physical, Earth & Space)
Axis 3 (Z): DOK Levels (1, 2, 3)

A highlighted "sample item" cube appears at the intersection of:
- SP.3 (Reasoning from Data)
- Life Science
- DOK Level 2

Interactive elements:
- Three dropdown menus or sliders to select Practice, Content, and DOK
- When a combination is selected, the corresponding cube highlights and shows a sample question
- 3-5 pre-loaded sample questions for common combinations
- Hover over any axis label to see its definition

Visual style: Isometric 3D grid with semi-transparent planes. Selected intersection glows.

Color scheme: Practices = blue axis, Content = green axis, DOK = orange axis

Implementation: p5.js with 3D perspective or Three.js lite
Canvas size: responsive, minimum 700x500px
</details>

!!! tip "Study Strategy"
    When studying for the GED Science Test, don't just read facts. Practice answering questions that combine a science practice with a content topic at DOK Level 2 or 3. This mirrors how the actual test works.

## The Scientific Method

The scientific method is a systematic approach to investigating questions about the natural world. While scientists don't always follow these steps in rigid order, the method provides a reliable framework for building knowledge through evidence.

The core steps of the scientific method are:

1. **Ask a Question** — identify something you want to understand
2. **Research** — learn what is already known about the topic
3. **Form a Hypothesis** — propose a testable explanation
4. **Experiment** — design and carry out a test of the hypothesis
5. **Analyze Data** — examine the results of your experiment
6. **Draw Conclusions** — determine whether the data supports your hypothesis
7. **Communicate Results** — share your findings so others can evaluate and build on them

The scientific method is not a one-time path. Scientists frequently revisit earlier steps. If the data does not support the hypothesis, a scientist revises the hypothesis and tests again. This iterative nature is what makes science self-correcting.

#### Diagram: Scientific Method Cycle

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Scientific Method Cycle</summary>
Type: microsim

Bloom Taxonomy: Apply
Bloom Taxonomy Verb: demonstrate
Learning Objective: Demonstrate the steps of the scientific method by walking through a worked example, showing how each step connects to the next and how the process can loop back.

Purpose: Interactive simulation where students step through the scientific method using a concrete example (e.g., "Does fertilizer affect plant growth?"). At each step, the student sees what a scientist would do and can make choices.

Visual elements:
- Circular arrangement of 7 steps as labeled nodes
- Central area showing the current step's details
- A "worked example" panel showing a concrete scenario
- Progress indicator showing which steps have been completed

Worked Example Scenario: "Does adding fertilizer make tomato plants grow taller?"
- Step 1 (Question): "Does fertilizer affect plant height?"
- Step 2 (Research): "Previous studies show nitrogen promotes growth"
- Step 3 (Hypothesis): "Plants given fertilizer will grow taller than plants without fertilizer"
- Step 4 (Experiment): "Plant 20 tomato plants: 10 with fertilizer, 10 without. Measure height weekly for 6 weeks."
- Step 5 (Analyze): Show a simple data table and bar chart of average heights
- Step 6 (Conclude): "The data supports the hypothesis — fertilized plants grew 40% taller on average"
- Step 7 (Communicate): "Write a lab report and share results"

Interactive controls:
- "Next Step" and "Previous Step" buttons
- At Step 3, student can choose between two hypotheses (one testable, one not) — feedback explains why
- At Step 5, data table and mini bar chart appear showing results
- At Step 6, student selects whether the hypothesis was supported or not — feedback given

Data Visibility Requirements:
  Stage 1: Show the research question in a text box
  Stage 2: Show background research notes as bullet points
  Stage 3: Show hypothesis with testable/not-testable choice
  Stage 4: Show experimental setup as a simple diagram (control vs. treatment)
  Stage 5: Show data table with measurements and a bar chart summary
  Stage 6: Show conclusion statement linked back to hypothesis
  Stage 7: Show communication summary

Instructional Rationale: Step-through with a worked example is appropriate because the Apply/demonstrate objective requires learners to trace the process with concrete data. Each step builds on the previous one, making sequential exploration more effective than free navigation.

## Evidence-Based Reasoning

Evidence-based reasoning means forming conclusions based on observable, measurable data rather than personal opinions, feelings, or assumptions. This is the foundation of all scientific thinking, and it is heavily tested on the GED Science exam.

There are key differences between evidence-based conclusions and unsupported opinions:

| Characteristic | Evidence-Based Conclusion | Opinion or Assumption |
|---------------|--------------------------|----------------------|
| Based on | Data, observations, measurements | Personal beliefs, feelings |
| Can be tested | Yes — others can verify | Not always |
| Can be revised | Yes — new evidence can change it | Resistant to change |
| Example | "Patients who exercised 30 min/day had lower blood pressure" | "Exercise is probably good for you" |

When evaluating evidence, ask yourself these questions:

- What data was collected?
- How was it collected?
- Does the conclusion logically follow from the data?
- Could there be other explanations?

#### Diagram: Evidence Evaluation Decision Tree

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Evidence Evaluation Decision Tree</summary>
Type: workflow

Bloom Taxonomy: Evaluate
Bloom Taxonomy Verb: assess
Learning Objective: Assess whether a scientific claim is supported by evidence by following a structured decision-making process.

Purpose: Guide students through a series of yes/no questions to evaluate whether a scientific claim is well-supported by evidence. This helps build the critical thinking habit of questioning claims systematically.

Visual style: Top-down decision tree flowchart

Steps:
1. Start: "Read the Scientific Claim"
Hover text: "Identify what the claim states and what evidence is provided."

2. Decision: "Is evidence provided?"
Hover text: "Look for data, measurements, observations, or experimental results."
- No → "Unsupported Claim" (red endpoint)
- Yes → Continue

3. Decision: "Is the evidence relevant to the claim?"
Hover text: "Does the evidence directly relate to what is being claimed?"
- No → "Irrelevant Evidence" (orange endpoint)
- Yes → Continue

4. Decision: "Is the evidence sufficient?"
Hover text: "Is there enough data? Was the sample size large enough?"
- No → "Insufficient Evidence" (yellow endpoint)
- Yes → Continue

5. Decision: "Could other explanations account for the evidence?"
Hover text: "Are there confounding variables or alternative hypotheses?"
- Yes → "Claim Needs Further Investigation" (blue endpoint)
- No → "Well-Supported Claim" (green endpoint)

Interactive elements:
- Students can click through each decision with a provided example claim
- Three sample claims are available to practice with:
  1. "Vitamin C cures the common cold" (weak evidence)
  2. "Smoking increases lung cancer risk" (strong evidence)
  3. "Full moons cause more emergency room visits" (correlation, not causation)
- At each decision node, the student selects Yes or No and receives feedback

Color coding:
- Decision diamonds: light blue
- Endpoints: red (unsupported), orange (irrelevant), yellow (insufficient), blue (needs more), green (supported)
- Arrows: gray with black labels

## Data Interpretation

Data interpretation is the ability to read, understand, and draw meaning from data presented in various formats. On the GED Science Test, data appears in many forms:

- **Tables** — rows and columns of numbers or categories
- **Line graphs** — showing trends over time
- **Bar graphs** — comparing quantities across categories
- **Pie charts** — showing proportions of a whole
- **Scatter plots** — showing relationships between two variables
- **Diagrams** — labeled illustrations of structures or processes

When interpreting data, follow these steps:

1. **Read the title and labels** — understand what the data represents
2. **Identify the variables** — what is being measured and what is being changed
3. **Look for patterns** — trends, clusters, outliers, or correlations
4. **Draw conclusions** — what does the data tell you about the question being asked
5. **Consider limitations** — what the data does *not* show

## Scientific Literacy

Scientific literacy means having the knowledge and skills to understand science as it appears in everyday life — in news articles, product labels, medical information, and public policy debates. A scientifically literate person can:

- Read and understand a scientific news article
- Evaluate health claims made by advertisers
- Understand environmental reports and their implications
- Make informed decisions about personal health and safety
- Distinguish between science and pseudoscience

Scientific literacy does not mean knowing everything about every branch of science. It means knowing *how* to evaluate scientific information, even in unfamiliar subject areas.

#### Diagram: Scientific Literacy Components

## Quantitative and Qualitative Reasoning

Scientists work with two fundamental types of data, and understanding the difference is important for the GED Science Test.

### Quantitative Reasoning

Quantitative reasoning involves working with **numbers and measurements**. Quantitative data can be counted, measured, or expressed numerically. Examples include:

- Temperature readings (98.6°F)
- Population counts (7,000 bacteria colonies)
- Distances (384,400 km to the Moon)
- Percentages (60% of test questions at DOK 2 or 3)

Quantitative reasoning skills include reading data tables, performing calculations, interpreting graphs with numerical axes, and understanding units of measurement.

### Qualitative Reasoning

Qualitative reasoning involves working with **descriptions, categories, and observations** that are not easily expressed as numbers. Examples include:

- Color changes during a chemical reaction (turned blue)
- Behavioral observations (the mice avoided the light)
- Texture or appearance (the rock was rough and layered)
- Categorical classifications (vertebrate vs. invertebrate)

Both types of reasoning are essential. Many GED Science questions present a mix of quantitative and qualitative information.

| Feature | Quantitative Data | Qualitative Data |
|---------|------------------|-----------------|
| Format | Numbers, measurements | Descriptions, categories |
| Examples | Height, temperature, count | Color, texture, behavior |
| Analysis tools | Graphs, statistics, calculations | Classification, comparison, observation |
| GED question type | "Calculate the mean..." | "Based on the description, classify..." |

## Scientific Inquiry

Scientific inquiry is the active process of asking questions and seeking answers through investigation. While the scientific method gives you a structured procedure, scientific inquiry is the broader mindset behind it. Inquiry-driven scientists are curious, persistent, and open to unexpected results.

Scientific inquiry can take many forms:

- **Experimental inquiry** — testing a hypothesis through controlled experiments
- **Descriptive inquiry** — observing and documenting phenomena without manipulating variables
- **Comparative inquiry** — examining similarities and differences between groups or conditions
- **Correlational inquiry** — investigating whether two variables are related

On the GED Science Test, you may need to identify what type of inquiry a researcher used, or explain why a particular approach was chosen for a given question.

#### Diagram: Types of Scientific Inquiry

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Types of Scientific Inquiry</summary>
Type: infographic

Bloom Taxonomy: Analyze
Bloom Taxonomy Verb: compare
Learning Objective: Compare the four types of scientific inquiry and determine which type is most appropriate for different research questions.

Purpose: Present the four types of inquiry side by side with examples, strengths, and limitations. Students can explore each type and practice matching research questions to inquiry types.

Layout: Four-panel display arranged in a 2x2 grid

Panel 1: Experimental Inquiry
- Icon: Flask with bubbles
- Description: Tests cause-and-effect by manipulating variables
- Example: "Does caffeine affect reaction time?"
- Strength: Can establish causation
- Limitation: Requires controlled conditions

Panel 2: Descriptive Inquiry
- Icon: Magnifying glass with notepad
- Description: Observes and records without changing anything
- Example: "What species live in this tide pool?"
- Strength: Captures natural behavior
- Limitation: Cannot establish cause-and-effect

Panel 3: Comparative Inquiry
- Icon: Two side-by-side boxes with arrows
- Description: Examines differences between groups
- Example: "How do male and female elk antlers differ?"
- Strength: Reveals important distinctions
- Limitation: Groups may differ in uncontrolled ways

Panel 4: Correlational Inquiry
- Icon: Scatter plot with trend line
- Description: Investigates relationships between variables
- Example: "Is income related to life expectancy?"
- Strength: Can analyze large datasets
- Limitation: Correlation does not imply causation

Below the grid: A "Practice" section with 4 research questions. Students click which inquiry type best fits each question.

Practice Questions:
1. "What plants grow in the Amazon rainforest canopy?" → Descriptive
2. "Does aspirin reduce fever faster than acetaminophen?" → Experimental
3. "Is there a relationship between sleep hours and GPA?" → Correlational
4. "How do Arctic and Antarctic penguin species compare?" → Comparative

Interactive elements:
- Click each panel to expand with more detail
- Practice section provides immediate feedback with explanations
- A "Score" tracker for the practice questions

Color scheme: Each inquiry type has a distinct color — Experimental (blue), Descriptive (green), Comparative (orange), Correlational (purple)

## Scientific Communication

Scientific communication is the process of sharing scientific findings, ideas, and data with others. Effective communication is essential because science advances when researchers share their work and others can evaluate, replicate, and build on it.

On the GED Science Test, you will need to understand how scientific information is communicated in multiple formats:

- **Written reports and articles** — structured text with introduction, methods, results, and conclusions
- **Data visualizations** — graphs, charts, and tables that present findings visually
- **Verbal explanations** — clear spoken or written descriptions of scientific concepts
- **Scientific arguments** — claims supported by evidence and reasoning

Good scientific communication has several key characteristics:

- **Clarity** — the message is easy to understand
- **Accuracy** — the information is correct and precise
- **Evidence-based** — claims are supported by data
- **Appropriate format** — the right type of visualization or text for the audience and data

Bloom Taxonomy: Understand
Bloom Taxonomy Verb: explain
Learning Objective: Explain the process by which scientific findings are communicated, from data collection through publication and public understanding.

Purpose: Show the flow of scientific communication from researcher to public, including the peer review process, media interpretation, and public understanding. This helps students understand where scientific information comes from and how it reaches them.

Steps:
1. "Researcher Collects Data"
Hover text: "Scientists gather data through experiments, observations, or surveys."

2. "Researcher Writes Paper"
Hover text: "Findings are written up in a structured format: introduction, methods, results, discussion."

3. "Peer Review"
Hover text: "Other scientists review the paper for accuracy, methodology, and conclusions before publication."

4. Decision: "Accepted?"
- Yes → "Published in Scientific Journal"
- No → "Revise and Resubmit" (loops back to step 2)

5. "Published in Scientific Journal"
Hover text: "The findings become part of the scientific record and can be cited by others."

6. "Media Reports on Findings"
Hover text: "Journalists translate scientific papers into news articles. Accuracy can vary."

7. "Public Reads and Interprets"
Hover text: "The general public encounters the findings through news, social media, or educational materials."
