# Learning Graph

The learning graph shows how all 200 GED Science concepts connect and depend on each other. Understanding these relationships helps you learn concepts in the correct order and see how scientific knowledge builds systematically.

## Graph Structure

The learning graph is organized by:

- **Taxonomy Categories**: Foundation Concepts, Comprehension, Investigation Design, Reasoning from Data, Evaluating Conclusions, Scientific Theories, Expression of Information, Probability & Statistics, and Life Science
- **Concept Dependencies**: Shows which concepts must be learned before others
- **200 Total Concepts**: Covering all GED Science Assessment Targets

## Key Files

- [Course Description](course-description.md) - Overview of learning objectives
- [Concept Enumeration](list-concepts.md) - Complete list of all 200 concepts
- [Learning Graph Data](learning-graph.json) - Interactive visualization data
- [Quality Metrics](quality-metrics.md) - Graph structure analysis
- [Taxonomy Distribution](taxonomy-distribution.md) - Concept categorization

## Using the Learning Graph

The learning graph helps you:

1. **Identify prerequisites** - See what you need to know before learning a concept
2. **Understand relationships** - See how concepts connect across different topics
3. **Plan your study** - Follow the dependency structure for efficient learning
4. **Review connections** - Understand how scientific knowledge is interconnected

## Interactive Visualization

The learning graph can be visualized using the graph viewer. Each concept is color-coded by its taxonomy category, and arrows show dependency relationships.
