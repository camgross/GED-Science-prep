# Getting Started with GED Science Prep

## Overview

This guide will help you get started with the GED Science preparation materials.

## Course Structure

The GED Science curriculum is organized into 12 chapters covering 200 concepts. Each chapter builds on previous concepts, so it's recommended to work through them in order.

## How to Use This Resource

1. **Start with Chapter 1** - Scientific Reasoning Foundations establishes the core concepts you'll need
2. **Work through chapters sequentially** - Concepts build on each other
3. **Use the Learning Graph** - Check concept dependencies if you're unsure about prerequisites
4. **Interact with MicroSims** - Visual and interactive elements help reinforce learning
5. **Review regularly** - Revisit previous chapters to reinforce understanding

## Learning Objectives

By completing this course, you will be able to:

- Comprehend scientific presentations (text, graphs, tables, diagrams)
- Design scientific investigations
- Reason from data and evidence
- Evaluate scientific claims and theories
- Express scientific information clearly
- Apply scientific models and theories
- Use probability and statistics
- Integrate concepts across scientific disciplines

## Assessment Format

The GED Science Test includes:

- **90 minutes** to complete
- **34-40 questions** covering all content domains
- **60% of questions** at Depth of Knowledge (DOK) level 2 or 3
- Questions may include text passages, graphs, charts, tables, and diagrams

## Study Tips

1. **Take notes** as you read each chapter
2. **Complete interactive exercises** in the MicroSims
3. **Review the Learning Graph** to see how concepts connect
4. **Practice with sample questions** (when available)
5. **Focus on understanding** rather than memorization
